check for compliance with https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/17634#discussion_r1622453325
basically

    In both cases the script installed contains the ${TARGET_ROOT}
    in the shebang when it shouldn't, but specificaly using --root
    behaves the way I would expect --prefix to work if no prefix had
    been set in the configure script.

The expected install locations for pip3 should be:

    --prefix : ${PREFIX}/bin/pip3 with shebang #!${PREFIX}/bin/python3
    --root (assuming no prefix) : ${ROOT}/bin/pip3 with shebang #!/bin/python3
    --prefix and --root : ${ROOT}${PREFIX}/bin/pip3 with shebang #!${PREFIX}/bin/python3

(And all that with various values of `with-ensurepip` `./configure` option)
